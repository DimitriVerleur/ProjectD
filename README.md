Flood Risk Mapping

This project aims to create a flood risk mapping tool that simulates potential flood zones based on terrain data. The project will utilize Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) to analyze terrain elevation and then simulate flood scenarios under various sea-levels. The end goal is to identify regions with high flood risk and visualize potential flood zones.
Flooding is a critical natural hazard that affects millions of people globally. Identifying flood-prone areas is essential for disaster preparedness, urban planning, and environmental management. This project will leverage Python and publicly available geographic data(AHN) to simulate flood events, providing a valuable tool for assessing flood risk in different regions.
