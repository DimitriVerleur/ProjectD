Flood Risk Mapping

This project aims to create a flood risk mapping tool that simulates potential flood zones based on terrain data and rainfall patterns. The project will utilize Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) to analyze terrain features such as elevation and slope and then simulate flood scenarios under various rainfall intensities. The end goal is to identify regions with high flood risk, visualize potential flood zones, and analyze the impact on the surrounding environment.
Flooding is a critical natural hazard that affects millions of people globally. Identifying flood-prone areas is essential for disaster preparedness, urban planning, and environmental management. This project will leverage Python and publicly available geographic data to simulate flood events, providing a valuable tool for assessing flood risk in different regions.
